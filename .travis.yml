 ## Build Matrix

 For Java projects, `env` and `jdk` can be given as arrays
 to construct a build matrix.

 ## Switching JDKs Within One Job

 If your build needs to switch JDKs during a job, you can do so with `jdk_switcher use â€¦`.

 ```yaml
 script:
   - jdk_switcher use oraclejdk8
   - # do stuff with Java 8
   - jdk_switcher use oraclejdk7
   - # do stuff with Java 7
